# CSE216-HW1-OCaml
This is my repository for HW#1 in the course "CSE216: Programming Abstractions." There are 3 ML files in this repository.

The first file named "hw1.ml" contains 10 (actually 11) recursive functions:
#1 takes 2 integers, x and n, and returns x to the nth power, a second function does the same but for a float instead of an int.
#2 removes consecutive duplicates from a list.
#3 takes a list and a predicate and removes any elements that do no meet the condition of the predicate.
#4 takes a list and two integers i and j and returns a sublist starting from index i and ending at index j.
#5 takes a list and a function as an argument and partitions it into equivalence classes based on what's specified in the function.
#6 takes an int and returns its Goldbach pair in non-decreasing order.
#7 takes 2 functions f and g and a list and returns true if f and g have identical behavior on the list.
#8 takes a function as an argument and a list, the input function takes 2 elements from the list at a time and returns one, and adds it to a new list.
#9 takes a list of tuples and creates a polynomial function.
#10 takes a list and treats it as a set and returns its powerset.

The next two files focus on "Algebraic Data Types."

The second file named "hw1bool.ml" defines a recursive data type for a truth table and a function that takes in an argument and returns its truth value.

The third file named "hw1math.ml" defines a recursive data type for arithmetic expressions, and a function that evaluates arithmetic expressions.
